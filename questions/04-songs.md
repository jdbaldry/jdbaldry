# Songs

## 1. ('20s)
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal

## 2. ('10s)
Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist

## 3. ('00s)
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind

## 4. ('90s)
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend

## 5. ('80s)
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

## 6. ('70s)
When you're weary, feeling small,
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all

## 7. ('60s)
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me

## 8. ('50s)
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane

## 9. ('40s)
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful

## 10. ('30s)
Have you seen the well to do
Up and down Park Avenue
